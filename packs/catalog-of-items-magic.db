When this happens, the piglet is permanently destroyed, and its contents are lost. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way and cannot be reopened again.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"Wondrous item"},"source":"","quantity":1,"weight":3,"price":0,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"rare","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":10,"type":"trinket","dex":null},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"baseItem":"","speed":{"value":null,"conditions":""},"strength":0,"stealth":false,"proficient":true,"toolType":"","properties":{"mgc":true}},"effects":[],"folder":"9w0CnxS0du0ZePFo","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"FRHavFG1029uVyVE":3},"flags":{},"_id":"M5W6E2YKkQBFCNp5"}
