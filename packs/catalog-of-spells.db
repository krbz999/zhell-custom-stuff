Divination spells cannot locate or perceive the target.</p>\n<p>When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Burial.</strong> The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it. The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.</li>\n<li><strong>Chaining.</strong> Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it cannot move or be moved by any means until then. The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.</li>\n<li><strong>Hedged Prison.</strong> The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice. The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.</li>\n<li><strong>Minimus Containment.</strong> The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone cannot be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect. The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.</li>\n<li><strong>Slumber.</strong> The target falls asleep and cannot be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Ending the Spell.</strong> During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the GM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.</p>\n<p>A magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.</p>\n<p>You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time.

Whenever the familiar drops to 0 hit points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.</p>\n<p>While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.

Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it.

For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p>\n<p><strong>Similar Area.</strong> You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p>\n<p><strong>Mishap.</strong> The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":"inst"},"target":{"value":8,"width":null,"units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":10,"long":null,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":7,"school":"con","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":false,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"FRHavFG1029uVyVE":3},"flags":{}}
