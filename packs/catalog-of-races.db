An aasimar is always born for a specific purpose, a goal of their deity, and they each have a divine guide with whom they can commune. Aasimar are incredibly rare, and appear with glowing eyes and other luminous features that reveal their heritage.</p>\n<p>They appear in humanoid lineages, but whichever family an aasimar originates from, they nonetheless possess only the traits of an aasimar and appear to look more like which deity has blessed them. An aasimar born in an orcish family but blessed by Veil might look distinctly elvish instead of orcish.</p>\n<p>Some of these divine chosen champions stray from their path, either by choice or due to some corruption; these are called defected aasimar. The defected aasimar do not necessarily have a divine guide, and often forge their own path — often one of destruction.</p>\n<p>Aasimar are not infertile, though their children are whatever race the other parent is. This sometimes makes them very attractive to people who wish to keep their bloodline pure.</p>\n<p>Aasimar have the potential to become ageless if they fulfill the purpose they were created for, and said creator grants them this level of immortality. Usually an aasimar also has a guaranteed spot in their deity's divine domain unless they really messed up badly in life.</p>\n<p>Their souls are immortal, and one who does mess up badly, and has lived an evil life too far from the path laid before them, are reincarnated upon death as a rakshasa. Likewise with rakshasa, they may become reincarnated as aasimar. Upon reincarnation, they do not retain their memories of past selves unless granted access to them by a higher being.</p>\n</details><details open=\"open\">\n<summary>Aasimar Traits</summary>\n<p>As an aasimar, you have the following traits, which replace any traits you would have had from your material lineage.

Unlike your Defected cousins, you have yet to stray from the path set before you. You have the following additional traits.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Divine Guide.</strong></em> You have been granted a divine guide. Work with your DM to decide the nature of the guide, and if it is known to you. Once during a long rest, you may commune with it for guidance. The DM chooses the nature of the interaction, such as an omen in a dream, direct counsel, or something else.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Healing Hands.</strong></em> As an action, you can touch a creature and roll a number of d4s equal to your proficiency bonus. The target regains hit points equal to the rolled total unless it is undead or a construct. Once you use this trait, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Lightbringer.</strong></em> You know the @Compendium[zhell-custom-stuff.catalog-of-spells.8fl4H6nk1Luv93Cy]{Light} cantrip. At 6th level, you learn the @Compendium[zhell-custom-stuff.catalog-of-spells.jTDSFwl4RNsajNZU]{Daylight} spell, and at 10th level you learn the @Compendium[zhell-custom-stuff.catalog-of-spells.sNy9Vu0v6kFxJsV5]{Dawn} spell. You may cast each of these spells once for free and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. You can also cast them with any spell slots you may have. Your favored deity decides the spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Awaken Radiance.</strong></em> Starting at 4th level, your innate divine power has materialised. You can call upon it as an action, causing your eyes to erupt in a fiery blaze. This transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. For the duration, you deal an additional 1d4 radiant damage with every weapon attack. The transformation increases in power as you reach 8th and 12th level.</p>\n<p>Starting at 8th level, when you transform, and as an action for the duration, you can shoot beams of radiant energy out of your eyes. Make a ranged spell attack against one target within 60 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes radiant damage equal to 2d8 + your ability modifier. Your favored deity decides the ability score used for this transformation. If you have a feature that allows you to make multiple attacks as part of the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.</p>\n<p>Once you reach 12th level, the transformation reaches its peak. It now also grants you a flying speed of 30 feet for the duration, as two luminous, incorporeal wings sprout from your back. Immediately when you transform, you end the frightened condition on any creature you choose within 30 feet of you provided that they can see or hear you.</p>\n<p>Once you use this trait, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n</details>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"FRHavFG1029uVyVE":3},"flags":{"custom-character-sheet-sections":{"sectionName":""},"mre-dnd5e":{"formulaGroups":[{"label":"Primary","formulaSet":[]}]},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.kxpqIx9vSV94oaeh"}},"_id":"zxPQ0vI6poIiqhj4"}
