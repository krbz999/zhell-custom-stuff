you gain the following class features.</p>\n<h2>Hit Points</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per monk level.<br /><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per monk level after 1st.<br /><strong>Armor Proficiencies:</strong> None.<br /><strong>Weapon Proficiencies:</strong> Simple weapons, shortswords.<br /><strong>Tools:</strong> Choose one type of artisan's tools or one musical instrument.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Selected: </em><em>Painter's Supplies.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Strength, Dexterity.<br /><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Insight, Religion, and Stealth.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Selected: Acrobatics, Athletics.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Equipment</h2>\n<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(a) a shortsword or (b) any simple weapon</li>\n<li>(a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack</li>\n<li>10 darts</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Unarmored Defense</h2>\n<p><em>1st-level Monk feature</em></p>\n<p>While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h2>Martial Arts</h2>\n<p><em>1st-level Monk feature</em></p>\n<p>Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that do not have the two-handed or heavy property.</p>\n<p>You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</li>\n<li>You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.</li>\n<li>When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you have not already taken a bonus action this turn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama).</p>\n<h2>Ki</h2>\n<p><em>2nd-level Monk feature</em></p>\n<p>Your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.</p>\n<p>You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.</p>\n<p>When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.</p>\n<p>Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Ki save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<p><em><strong>Flurry of Blows.</strong></em> Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Patient Defense.</strong></em> You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Step of the Wind.</strong></em> You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.</p>\n<h2>Unarmored Movement</h2>\n<p><em>2nd-level Monk feature</em></p>\n<p>Your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.</p>\n<h2>Dedicated Weapon</h2>\n<p><em>2nd-level Monk feature</em></p>\n<p>You train yourself to use a variety of weapons as monk weapons, not just simple melee weapons and shortswords.</p>\n<p>Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can touch one weapon, focus your ki on it, and then count that weapon as a monk weapon until you use this feature again. The chosen weapon must meet these criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The weapon must be a simple or martial weapon.</li>\n<li>You must be proficient with it.</li>\n<li>It must lack the heavy and special properties.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Monastic Tradition</h2>\n<p><em>3rd-level Monk feature</em></p>\n<p>You commit yourself to a @Compendium[world.journals.Available Classes]{monastic tradition}. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</p>\n<h2>Deflect Missiles</h2>\n<p><em>3rd-level Monk feature</em></p>\n<p>You can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.</p>\n<p>If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p>\n<h2>Ki-Fueled Attack</h2>\n<p><em>3rd-level Monk feature</em></p>\n<p>If you spend 1 ki point or more as part of your action on your turn, you can make one attack with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon as a bonus action before the end of the turn.</p>\n<h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>\n<p><em>4th-level Monk feature</em></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<h2>Slow Fall</h2>\n<p><em>4th-level Monk feature</em></p>\n<p>You can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.</p>\n<h2>Quickened Healing</h2>\n<p><em>4th-level Monk feature</em></p>\n<p>As an action, you can spend 2 ki points and roll a Martial Arts die. You regain a number of hit points equal to the number rolled plus your proficiency bonus.</p>\n<h2>Extra Attack</h2>\n<p><em>5th-level Monk feature</em></p>\n<p>You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n<h2>Stunning Strike</h2>\n<p><em>5th-level Monk feature</em></p>\n<p>You can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent's body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<h2>Focused Aim</h2>\n<p><em>5th-level Monk feature</em></p>\n<p>When you miss with an attack roll, you can spend 1 to 3 ki points to increase your attack roll by 2 for each of these ki points you spend, potentially turning the miss into a hit.</p>\n<h2>Ki-Empowered Strikes</h2>\n<p><em>6th-level Monk feature</em></p>\n<p>Your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>\n<h2>Evasion</h2>\n<p><em>7th-level Monk feature</em></p>\n<p>Your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a <em>fireball</em> spell.

warlock level after 1st.<br /><strong>Armor Proficiencies:</strong> Light armor.<br /><strong>Weapon Proficiencies:</strong> Simple weapons.<br /><strong>Tools:</strong> None.<br /><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Wisdom, Charisma.<br /><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Arcana, Deception, History, Intimidation, Investigation, Nature, and Religion.</p>\n<h2>Equipment</h2>\n<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon</li>\n<li>(a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus</li>\n<li>(a) a scholar's pack or (b) a dungeoneer's pack</li>\n<li>Leather armor, any simple weapon, and two daggers</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Otherworldly Patron</h2>\n<p><em>1st-level Warlock feature</em></p>\n<p>You have struck a bargain with an @Compendium[world.journals.Available Classes]{otherworldly being} of your choice. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n<h2>Pact Magic</h2>\n<p><em>1st-level Warlock feature</em></p>\n<p>Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells. See @Compendium[world.journals.Warlock Spells] for the warlock spell list.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Cantrips.</strong></em> You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Spell Slots.</strong></em> The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher.</strong></em> At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list. The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what is shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong></em> Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<p><em><strong>Spellcasting Focus.</strong></em> You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.</p>\n<h2>Eldritch Invocations</h2>\n<p><em>2nd-level Warlock feature</em></p>\n<p>In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed @Compendium[world.journals.Eldritch Invocations], fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.</p>\n<p>You gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.</p>\n<p>If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.</p>\n<h2>Pact Boon</h2>\n<p><em>3rd-level Warlock feature</em></p>\n<p>Your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice: @Compendium[world.journals.Pact Boons]</p>\n<h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>\n<p><em>4th-level Warlock feature</em></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>In addition, at these levels, you can <span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">do one of the following, representing a change of focus in your occult studies:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Pact Magic feature with another cantrip from the warlock spell list.</li>\n<li>Replace the option you chose for the Pact Boon feature with one of that feature's other options.</li>\n<li>If you are 12th level or higher, replace one spell from your Mystic Arcanum feature with another warlock spell of the same level.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If this change makes you ineligible for any of your Eldritch Invocations, you must also replace them now, choosing invocations for which you qualify.</p>\n<h2>Mystic Arcanum</h2>\n<p><em>11th-level Warlock feature</em></p>\n<p>Your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.</p>\n<p>You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>\n<p>At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Eldritch Master</h2>\n<p><em>20th-level Warlock feature</em></p>\n<p>You can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"warlock","levels":3,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"5o4lljbq02d82ek3","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":"avg","3":"avg"}},{"_id":"1xl0561sqrp0y24q","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Item.9kcSBoJ9HICvRYtr"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":1,"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"28fcgntck3gy216j","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Item.iIaJFjOrUohRIbXF"],"optional":true},"value":{},"level":1,"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","dec","his","itm","inv","nat","rel"],"value":["arc","rel"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"pact","ability":"cha"},"subclass":"The Celestial","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"FRHavFG1029uVyVE":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"eQfmKVVohIPVSwBX","name":"Otherworldly Patron: The Celestial","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/holy/chalice-glowing-yellow-blue.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Your patron is a powerful being of the Upper Planes.

You have a pool of d6s that you spend to fuel this healing. The number of dice in the pool equals 1 + your warlock level.</p>\n<p>As a bonus action, you can heal one creature you can see within 60 feet of you, spending dice from the pool.

Those creatures each gain temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level + your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h2>Searing Vengeance</h2>\n<p><em>14th-level Celestial feature</em></p>\n<p>The radiant energy you channel allows you to resist death. When you have to make a death saving throw at the start of your turn, you can instead spring back to your feet with a burst of radiant energy. You regain hit points equal to half your hit point maximum, and then you stand up if you so choose. Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you takes radiant damage equal to 2d8 + your Charisma modifier, and it is blinded until the end of the current turn.</p>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"FRHavFG1029uVyVE":3},"flags":{"mre-dnd5e":{"formulaGroups":[{"label":"Primary","formulaSet":[]}]}}},{"_id":"9tw1zv1gPromK3Ol","name":"Healing Light","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/holy/projectiles-blades-salvo-yellow.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>You gain the ability to channel celestial energy to heal wounds.

You have a pool of d6s that you spend to fuel this healing. The number of dice in the pool equals 1 + your warlock level.</p>\n<p>As a bonus action, you can heal one creature you can see within 60 feet of you, spending dice from the pool.

You have resistance to radiant damage, and when you cast a spell that deals radiant or fire damage, you can add your Charisma modifier to one radiant or fire damage roll of that spell against one of its targets.</p>\n<h2>Celestial Resilience</h2>\n<p><em>10th-level Celestial feature</em></p>\n<p>You gain temporary hit points whenever you finish a short or long rest.

Those creatures each gain temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level + your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h2>Searing Vengeance</h2>\n<p><em>14th-level Celestial feature</em></p>\n<p>The radiant energy you channel allows you to resist death. When you have to make a death saving throw at the start of your turn, you can instead spring back to your feet with a burst of radiant energy. You regain hit points equal to half your hit point maximum, and then you stand up if you so choose. Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you takes radiant damage equal to 2d8 + your Charisma modifier, and it is blinded until the end of the current turn.</p>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"celestial","classIdentifier":"warlock","advancement":[{"_id":"38e66x37bo9xnsp6","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Item.oL6MAgsO6tJ2rFSP","Item.u2yuClFOXHEWJUAM"],"optional":false},"value":{"added":{"y3tuhneiuhf22t96":"Item.oL6MAgsO6tJ2rFSP","g3bbpm9qvbc7hc9r":"Item.u2yuClFOXHEWJUAM"}},"level":1},{"_id":"bwzs4sbfywfmmlie","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Item.bd6ajclIeF117B5M"],"optional":false},"value":{"added":{"h1v6jy5i3xoaxoq2":"Item.bd6ajclIeF117B5M"}},"level":1}],"spellcasting":{"progression":"pact","ability":"cha"},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"FRHavFG1029uVyVE":3},"flags":{"mre-dnd5e":{"formulaGroups":[{"label":"Primary","formulaSet":[]}]},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.iIaJFjOrUohRIbXF"}}},{"_id":"zvkmDeaA0fzA8jdU","name":"Quarterstaff","type":"weapon","img":"icons/weapons/staves/staff-simple-gold.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A thick shaft of wood wrapped with a sturdy grip makes a highly functional weapon in addition to a stout walking stick.</p><hr /><p><strong><em>Versatile.</em></strong> This weapon can be used with one or two hands.

and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours of study.</p>\n<p>Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them from other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic.</p>\n<p>Wizards' lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. Other wizards sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.</p>\n<p>But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.</p>\n<hr /><details>\n<summary>The Wizard Table</summary>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:center;width:1cm\" rowspan=\"2\">Level</th>\n<th

Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong></em> Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p><em><strong>Ritual Casting.</strong></em> You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You do not need to have the spell prepared.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Spellcasting Focus.</strong></em> You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher.</strong></em> Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook.</p>\n<hr /><details>\n<summary><strong>Your Spellbook</strong></summary>\n<p>The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book — for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n</details>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Wizard","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Wizard 1","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"FRHavFG1029uVyVE":3},"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.zhell-custom-stuff.catalog-of-features.tiMub6QfiDCreaHX","advancementOrigin":"lj2YUygGQS34HCxB.9ojqd2dejdsffabi"}}},{"_id":"ocpo1k5tcvqg5qpl","name":"Arcane Recovery","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/light/projectile-smoke-blue-white.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook.</p>\n<p>Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover.</p>\n<p>The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Wizard","activation":{"type":"special","cost":null,"condition":"as part of a short rest"},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":"1","per":"lr"},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Wizard 1","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"FRHavFG1029uVyVE":3},"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.zhell-custom-stuff.catalog-of-features.nmwUhd1EpEMqar2C","advancementOrigin":"lj2YUygGQS34HCxB.9ojqd2dejdsffabi"},"mre-dnd5e":{"formulaGroups":[{"label":"Primary","formulaSet":[]}]},"custom-character-sheet-sections":{"sectionName":""},"itemacro":{"macro":{"data":{"_id":null,"name":"Arcane Recovery","type":"script","author":"FRHavFG1029uVyVE","img":"icons/svg/dice-target.svg","scope":"global","command":"/*\n\tYou have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook.\n\tOnce per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover.\n\tThe spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up),\n\tand none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.\n*/\n\nconst lvl = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].filter(i => actor.data.data.spells['spell' + i].max > 0)\nconst val = lvl.map(i => actor.data.data.spells['spell' + i].value)\nconst max = lvl.map(i => actor.data.data.spells['spell' + i].max)\n\nif(lvl.filter(i => actor.data.data.spells['spell' + i].value !== actor.data.data.spells['spell' + i].max).length < 1) return ui.notifications.error(\"You are not missing any valid spell slots.\")\nconst roll = await item.roll()\nif(!roll) return\n\nconst maxVal = Math.ceil(actor.data.data.classes.wizard.levels / 2)\nlet spent = 0;\n\nfunction nth(n){return n + ([\"st\",\"nd\",\"rd\"][((n+90)%100-10)%10-1]||\"th\")}\n\nlet content = `<div name=\"header\"><p>Recovering spell slots: <strong>${spent}</strong> / ${maxVal}.</p></div><table>`\nfor(let i = 0; i < lvl.length; i++){\n\tcontent += `<tr><td style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>${nth(i+1)}-level:</strong></td><td>`\n\tfor(let j = 0; j < max[i]; j++){\n\t\tcontent += `<input type=\"checkbox\" value=\"${i+1}\" name=\"level${lvl[i]}\" ${j < val[i] ?

daggers</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Spellcasting</h2>\n<p><em>1st-level Sorcerer feature</em></p>\n<p>An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells. See @Compendium[zhell-custom-stuff.catalog-of-journals.Sorcerer Spells] for the sorcerer spell list.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Cantrips.</strong></em> You know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Spell Slots.</strong></em> The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher.</strong></em> You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.</p>\n<p>The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong></em> Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<p><em><strong>Spellcasting Focus.</strong></em> You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.</p>\n<h2>Sorcerous Origin</h2>\n<p><em>1st-level Sorcerer feature</em></p>\n<p>Choose a @Compendium[zhell-custom-stuff.catalog-of-journals.Available Classes]{sorcerous origin}, which describes the source of your innate magical power. Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.</p>\n<h2>Font of Magic</h2>\n<p><em>2nd-level Sorcerer feature</em></p>\n<p>You tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Sorcery Points.</strong></em> You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Flexible Casting.</strong></em> You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Creating Spell Slots.</strong></em> You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The below table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create spell slots no higher in level than 5th.</p>\n<p>Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<table style=\"width:6cm;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:center;width:3cm\">Spell<br />Slot<br />Level</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center;width:3cm\">Sorcery<br />Point<br />Cost</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">7</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><em><strong>Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points.</strong></em> As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the slot's level.</p>\n<h2>Metamagic</h2>\n<p><em>3rd-level Sorcerer feature</em></p>\n<p>You gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain two @Compendium[zhell-custom-stuff.catalog-of-journals.Metamagic Options] of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level. You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.</p>\n<h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>\n<p><em>4th-level Sorcerer feature</em></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>In addition, at these levels, you can do one of the following, representing the magic within you flowing in new ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Replace one of the options you chose for the Metamagic feature with a different Metamagic option available to you.</li>\n<li>Replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the sorcerer spell list.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Magical Guidance</h2>\n<p><em>5th-level Sorcerer feature</em></p>\n<p>You can tap into your inner wellspring of magic to try to conjure success from failure. When you make an ability check that fails, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll, potentially turning the failure into a success.</p>\n<h2>Sorcerous Restoration</h2>\n<p><em>20th-level Sorcerer feature</em></p>\n<p>You regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"sorcerer","levels":3,"hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z0r32rwuq8npiqho","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":6,"3":6}},{"_id":"m0u2o4l0mtn0ufix","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"points","type":"number","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"2":{"value":2},"3":{"value":3},"4":{"value":4},"5":{"value":5},"6":{"value":6},"7":{"value":7},"8":{"value":8},"9":{"value":9},"10":{"value":10},"11":{"value":11},"12":{"value":12},"13":{"value":13},"14":{"value":14},"15":{"value":15},"16":{"value":16},"17":{"value":17},"18":{"value":18},"19":{"value":19},"20":{"value":20}}},"value":{},"title":"Sorcery Points","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"y0tvnhw29w8ba475","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"metamagic","type":"number","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"3":{"value":2},"10":{"value":3},"17":{"value":4}}},"value":{},"title":"Metamagic","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["con","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","dec","ins","itm","per","rel"],"value":["ins","per"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"cha"},"subclass":"Storm Sorcery","damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":0,"critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"FRHavFG1029uVyVE":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.6T08zzKtmmpVwlXU"}}},{"_id":"5zA5K3n9V9HmTQaW","name":"Icoltia","type":"tool","img":"icons/commodities/cloth/thread-and-needle.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>A sturdy and almost oversized sewing needle made out of ivory.

1d10 per paladin level.<br /><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 10 + your Constitution modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per paladin level after 1st.<br /><strong>Armor Proficiencies:</strong> All armor, shields.<br /><strong>Weapon Proficiencies:</strong> Simple weapons, martial weapons.<br /><strong>Tools:</strong> None.<br /><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Wisdom, Charisma.<br /><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion.</p>\n<h2>Equipment</h2>\n<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons</li>\n<li>(a) five javelins or (b) any simple melee weapon</li>\n<li>(a) a priest's pack or (b) an explorer's pack</li>\n<li>Chain mail and a holy symbol</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Divine Sense</h2>\n<p><em>1st-level Paladin feature</em></p>\n<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.</p>\n<h2>Lay on Hands</h2>\n<p><em>1st-level Paladin feature</em></p>\n<p>Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5.</p>\n<p>As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.</p>\n<p>This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.</p>\n<h2>Fighting Style</h2>\n<p><em>2nd-level Paladin feature</em></p>\n<p>You adopt a @Compendium[world.journals.Fighting Styles (Paladin)]{style of fighting} as your specialty. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n<h2>Spellcasting</h2>\n<p><em>2nd-level Paladin feature</em></p>\n<p>You have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See the @Compendium[world.journals.Paladin Spells].</p>\n<p><em><strong>Preparing and Casting Spells.</strong></em> The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Casting a spell does not remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong></em> Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<p><em><strong>Spellcasting Focus.</strong></em> You can use a holy symbol (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</p>\n<h2>Divine Smite</h2>\n<p><em>2nd-level Paladin feature</em></p>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the damage of the attack. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.</p>\n<h2>Divine Health</h2>\n<p><em>3rd-level Paladin feature</em></p>\n<p>The divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.</p>\n<h2>Sacred Oath</h2>\n<p><em>3rd-level Paladin feature</em></p>\n<p>You swear the @Compendium[world.journals.Available Classes]{oath} that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and Channel Divinity options.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Oath Spells.</strong></em> Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells do not count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\n<p>If you gain an oath spell that does not appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Channel Divinity.</strong></em> Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.</p>\n<p>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\n<p>Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Harness Divine Power</h2>\n<p><em>3rd-level Paladin feature</em></p>\n<p>You can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to fuel your spells. As a bonus action, you touch your holy symbol, utter a prayer, and regain one expended spell slot, the level of which can be no higher than half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). The number of times you can use this feature is based on the level you have reached in this class: 3rd level, once; 7th level, twice; and 15th level, thrice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>\n<p><em>4th-level Paladin feature</em></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>In addition, at these levels, you can replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to paladins. This replacement represents a shift of focus in your martial practice.</p>\n<h2>Extra Attack</h2>\n<p><em>5th-level Paladin feature</em></p>\n<p>You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n<h2>Aura of Protection</h2>\n<p><em>6th-level Paladin feature</em></p>\n<p>Whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.</p>\n<p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>\n<h2>Aura of Courage</h2>\n<p><em>10th-level Paladin feature</em></p>\n<p>You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be frightened while you are conscious.</p>\n<p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>\n<h2>Improved Divine Smite</h2>\n<p><em>11th-level Paladin feature</em></p>\n<p>You are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon attacks carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.</p>\n<h2>Cleansing Touch</h2>\n<p><em>14th-level Paladin feature</em></p>\n<p>You can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"","levels":5,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":5,"advancement":[],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","prc","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"},"subclass":"Oath of Vengeance","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7T1QTgzirYVphUPd":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"EI3lVwN0k1Xi9hN8","name":"Divine Sense","type":"feat","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><em>1st-level Paladin feature</em></p>\n<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

At birth the young tiefling was given up by his parents and granted to the Waveside Orphanage at Murharbor. It was rough but not cruel. The other children were not exceptionally mean and there were even other tieflings there as well. In general it was just lonely. Other children would get adopted and new ones would come in but Arkorow would stay behind. It hurt at first but he would spend his time busying himself with chores and little jobs around town to keep his mind off of it. While returning back to the Waveside Orphanage one day he came across a discarded paper detailing the adventures of a few members of the Kane, Boole &amp; Smidt adventuring company. Snagging the paper Arkorow spent the rest of that day and much of the next pouring over every word with his someone limited education on language by that point. It was incredible! Daring dungeons, traps, and evil monsters. There was one adventure in particular though. Maximillium \"Bolt\" Gladius; also called 'Maxie the Evoker'. An eldritch knight so powerful they had been able to slay a Roc alone! Withstanding the blasts of Blue Dragons and Krakens. Beloved by all and decorated in armor crafted for him by storm giants. He was the best! For the next 6 years Arkorow did his best to emulate his idol; teaching himself magic and researching different creatures and powerful adventuring equipment. He came across much more in his research as well. The history of the region, wilderness tips, cooking recipes, but the most intriguing of his extra research was religion. The Waveside Orphanage had had a small bit of worship in it but it was only ever directed towards Thrizur, the Shelter. Arkorow found a few new paths though. Gods of forge and luck, knowledge and death. While many of them naturally called out in some small way one minor deitie - Arepo, The Forgotten Son - was of great interest. A god of natural beauties of the world, of bonds between allies and friends, tossed aside and forgotten by so many. It seemed so perfect. While not many would recognize it Arkorow began adding a small symbol to each of his creations. A small leaf, curved and surrounded by a tiny ring of fire. Arkorow made no plans to join a clerichood or become some sort of holy champion but the simple knowledge that he and his eventual allies would have such a benevolent being watching over them was comforting. To bankroll his studies and works Arkorow took up a more standard job on the docks as a fisherman. At age 16 a glorious ship rolled onto the docks. It was massive! And on it was small adventuring party from non-other than the Kane, Boole, &amp; Smidt company. They were decked out in magic gear and spending coin like no tomorrow; having just completed a fantastic quest no doubt. Too nervous to actually talk to them Arkorow just watched and listened. Eventually one of them actually came up and bought something. At least that's what he remembers, all he knows is the adventurer came up, gave him a gold coin, and then walked away. That coin currently sits around Arkorow's neck as his most treasured posession. Finally at age 19 Arkorow had saved enough money to get himself a more complete set of adventuring supplies. It was time to quest!</p>"},"alignment":"Chaotic Good","race":"Tiefling","background":"Dissatisfied Fishmonger","originalClass":"","xp":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":300},"appearance":"","trait":"<p>I ask a lot of questions.</p>\n<p>I sleep with my back to a wall or tree, with everything I own wrapped in a bundle in my arms.</p>\n<p>I hide scraps of food and trinkets away in my pockets.</p>","ideal":"<p>People.

If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.</p>\n<p>Placing a <em>bag of holding</em> inside an extradimensional space created by a <em>handy haversack</em>, <em>portable hole</em>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes.

As a result, you have gained the ability to cast spells. To observers, you do not appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if you are producing wonders using mundane items or outlandish inventions.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Tools Required.</strong></em> You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus — specifically thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool — in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an 'M' component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way.</p>\n<p>After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Cantrips.</strong></em> At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.</p>\n<p>When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Preparing and Casting Spells.</strong></em> The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the artificer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p>For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell does not remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong></em> Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill.

As night fell and the cold returned I built a fire; the light dancing off the brilliant crystals in the cave walls. Eventually, sleep took me, and when I awoke again the fire was gone. But the light remained, and I saw my reflection in the small pool of life-saving water. My skin had turned to ash and that same fire I had managed to cobble together seemed to have found a new home behind my eyes. I felt...whole. Exhausted but uninjured as I shakily stepped out into the sunlight. A second chance at life; it was some kind of lucky miracle.</p>\n<p><em>14th of Withertide's End, 98 PHR</em></p>\n<p>I had finally made it back to civilization. My \"home\" as it were in the Central Flatlands. My small set of skills had provided me well enough on the journey and I had managed to scrounge together a small pouch of gold pieces. Bartering for new clothes, rations, armor, and of course, a weapon; I made my way to Capital.</p>\n<p><em>8th of Suntide, 99 PHR</em></p>\n<p>It had taken nearly a year but I believed I had finally grown accustomed to my new body. Well enough to seek out some REAL work. A 'return alive' bounty on some run-away princess.&nbsp; Heiress? It didn't really matter in the end. She was uncooperative either way but we seem to have come to an accord. I'd help her get some revenge on some old acquaintances of hers and afterward, she'd come back with me to talk to mommy dearest again so I could collect my reward money. With any luck maybe I could make enough to finally start my life over proper.</p>"},"notes1":{"value":"<p>Head and Tail, the Twins of Luck: Torrid's chosen faith and who he most believes is responsible for his new form and chance at life.</p>"},"notes2":{"value":"<p>\"Cave of Redemption\" -&nbsp; The Eastern Sunlands: The cave where Torrid recovered after the betrayal of the Silvered Diver's.

Paladins who dedicate themselves to this oath believe that any person can be redeemed and that the path of benevolence and justice is one that anyone can walk. These paladins face evil creatures in the hope of turning their foes to the light, and they slay their enemies only when such a deed will clearly save other lives. Paladins who follow this path are known as redeemers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">While redeemers are idealists, they are no fools. Redeemers know that undead, demons, devils, and other supernatural threats can be inherently evil. Against such foes, paladins who swear this oath bring the full wrath of their weapons and spells to bear. Yet the redeemers still pray that, one day, even creatures of wickedness will invite their own redemption.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\"><strong>TENETS OF REDEMPTION</strong></p>\r\n<p>The tenets of the Oath of Redemption hold a paladin to a high standard of peace and justice.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Peace.</strong>&nbsp;Violence is a weapon of last resort. Diplomacy and understanding are the paths to long-lasting peace.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Innocence.</strong>&nbsp;All people begin life in an innocent state, and it is their environment or the influence of dark forces that drives them to evil. By setting the proper example, and working to heal the wounds of a deeply flawed world, you can set anyone on a righteous path.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Patience.</strong>&nbsp;Change takes time. Those who have walked the path of the wicked must be given reminders to keep them honest and true. Once you have planted the seed of righteousness in a creature, you must work day after day to allow that seed to survive and flourish.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Wisdom.</strong>&nbsp;Your heart and mind must stay clear, for eventually you will be forced to admit defeat. While every creature can be redeemed, some are so far along the path of evil that you have no choice but to end their lives for the greater good.

Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions.

To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a holy symbol (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</p>","resultString":"","definitions":[]},{"id":265,"componentId":null,"componentTypeId":null,"damageTypeId":null,"text":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.</p>","resultString":"","definitions":[]},{"id":266,"componentId":null,"componentTypeId":null,"damageTypeId":null,"text":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever.
