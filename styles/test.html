        <div class="havilon-race-description">
            <p>An aasimar is a humanoid creature born on the Material Plane who possesses a spark from a divine plane, often the realm of a Havilonian deity. An aasimar is always born for a specific purpose, a goal of their deity, and they each have a divine guide with whom they can commune. Aasimar are incredibly rare, and appear with glowing eyes and other luminous features that reveal their heritage.</p>
            <p>They appear in humanoid lineages, but whichever family an aasimar originates from, they nonetheless possess only the traits of an aasimar and appear to look more like which deity has blessed them. An aasimar born in an orcish family but blessed by Veil might look distinctly elvish instead of orcish.</p>
            <p>Some of these divine chosen champions stray from their path, either by choice or due to some corruption; these are called defected aasimar. The defected aasimar do not necessarily have a divine guide, and often forge their own path â€” often one of destruction.</p>
            <p>Aasimar are not infertile, though their children are whatever race the other parent is. This sometimes makes them very attractive to people who wish to keep their bloodline pure.</p>
            <p>Aasimar have the potential to become ageless if they fulfill the purpose they were created for, and said creator grants them this level of immortality. Usually an aasimar also has a guaranteed spot in their deity's divine domain unless they really messed up badly in life.</p>
            <p>Their souls are immortal, and one who does mess up badly, and has lived an evil life too far from the path laid before them, are reincarnated upon death as a rakshasa. Likewise with rakshasa, they may become reincarnated as aasimar. Upon reincarnation, they do not retain their memories of past selves unless granted access to them by a higher being.</p>

        <div class="havilon-race-description">
            <p>Rare even in the melting pot that is Havilon, caithuna tribes have settled on high altitudes primarily on the Great Chain, the mountain belt that divides Havilon into northern and southern regions.</p>
            <p>Caithuna names are sometimes natural objects, weather phenomena, or animals, such as Cloud, Timber, Smoke, or Snake. Each caithuna belongs to a clan whose names are based on their geographical location, such as Bright Cliffs or Rumbling River.</p>
            <p>The caithuna of Havilon are also known for their brewing talents. As a tribal race, the people often favor Thrizur and Draconiz. They are a diverse people that come in all shapes and sizes, from lithe to gigantic.</p>

        <h1 class="havilon-race-header">Dragonborn</h1>
        <div class="havilon-race-description">
            <p>Settled in the Eastern Sunlands, the dragonborn thrive under the scorching sun of the deserts that fill the region, sometimes settling in the canyons that spreads throughout like a maze. The dragonborn societies of Havilon see Draconiz, the Aspect of Nature, as their favored deity. They have a decades-long war with the orcs of the northern regions, whose raiding parties target the smaller dragonborn settlements and nomadic tribes. The dragonborn are not secular, though not many other races thrive as well as they do in the high temperatures, so most settlements in the Eastern Sunlands are predominantly dragonborn. Havilal, the First Explorer, was notably a bronze dragonborn, and this is a point of pride among the draconic settlers.</p>
            <p>Dragonborn have a single name with several hard consonants, appended with the name of their clan, whose name is always long and hard to pronounce for other peoples, such as Morbor of Teccushtar.</p>
            <p>The dragonborn are visually distinct from one another by the color of their scales as a member of either the chromatic, metallic, or the rarer gem dragonborn. Though draconic, the dragonborn have no tail or wings.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The chromatic dragonborn have scales of black, blue, green, red, or white.</li>
                <li>The metallic dragonborn have scales of brass, bronze, copper, gold, or silver.</li>
                <li>The gem dragonborn have scales intervowen with colors of amethyst, crystal, emerald, sapphire, or topaz.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the animal kingdom, whenever eggs need to be transported, a reptile parent carries them in the mouth, which is reasonably low to the ground, and thus accidentally dropping it is not too much of a danger. This is not the case with dragonborn, being bipedal creatures who carry their eggs around in their arms; dragonborn eggs have hence evolved a rubbery and bouncy shell, but of course now it is more common to secure the eggs in slings and holsters.</p>
            <p>Dragonborn architecture consists primarily of stone, as buildings burning down would otherwise be a very frequent problem when one sixth of your population is born with the ability to spew flames. For similar reasons, barbequed, smoked, marinated, and chilled food is a big part of dragonborn culture as well.</p>

        <h1 class="havilon-race-header">Dwarf</h1>
        <div class="havilon-race-description">
            <p>The dwarves settled with varying levels of success along the Great Chain, the mountain range spanning the continent from east to west. Here they have refurbished abandoned ruins in the bowels of the Chain to create a series of gargantuan fortresses as well as villages in the surrounding hillscapes.</p>
            <p>Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male and female dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully. Part of dwarven marriage ceremonies includes braiding rings or beads crafted by their new spouse into each other's beards.</p>
            <p>Most dwarves favor Anvil, either due to the familial link or by virtue of craftsmanship or artisanry.</p>
            <p>As a dwarf reaches the end of their life, they slowly start turning to stone over the last few decades, finally dying as it spreads to their chest and head. A dwarf that has died of old age is usually broken down into cement, then sculpted into a tile or similar for the family tomb.</p>
            <p>A dwarf that does not die to natural causes starts turning to stone the moment they draw their last breath. Over the course of an hour they become a statue. This has the consequence of leaving macabre statues around when a dwarf has died in tragic and remote circumstances. This, however, also makes it harder to quickly dispose of the body of a murdered dwarf.</p>

        <h1 class="havilon-race-header">Elf</h1>
        <div class="havilon-race-description">
            <p>The elven races have predominantly occupied the western region, so named the Elven Aristocracy by the then-dominant high elves of Ascalon.</p>
            <p>The Aristocracy is a haven for elves, druids, and arcane magic users. The high elves have situated themselves primarily in the Floating City, Ascalon, in the northern area of the Aristocracy, and the wood elves in the Greenwood Glades, a dense, miles-wide jungle forest on the north-east border between the Aristocracy and the Riverlands.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The high elves of Havilon live in seclusion atop Ascalon, the Floating City, in the Elven Aristocracy. Under the leadership of Sky Baron Gephostos, they are a high-magic, self-sufficient minor nation that rarely, if ever, allows anyone inside but other high elves or those who have earned their favor. Any high elf is by their very nature born with the ability to cast magic.</li>
                <li>The wood elves of Havilon live in harmony in the Greenwood Glades, just shy of the Great Chain mountains. The jungle-forest is a haven of fey and druidic magic on the border of the Elven Aristocracy. Upon death, wood elves of the Greenwood Glades or anywhere with a strong woodland connection are born into trees. This means the wood elf joins a grove and lives a second life as part of a hivemind.</li>
                <li>The dark elves, conversely, have not congregated to call a region their own. Commonly, many dark elves are not considered native to Havilon, but native to the Underdark as on many other continents, and dark elves who have left the Underdark behind to lead a life on the surface are few and far between. Unlike their cousins, the dark elves do not have an innate connection to magic, the elements, or nature, but to gemstones.</li>
                <li>The aquatic sea elves have founded a string of subterranean villages near the western and northern coasts of Havilon as an expansion of their underwater society since the rediscovery of the continent. They are a rare sight when you venture inland. An innately magical race like their high elven cousins, the sea elves are adept swimmers with strong ties to the weather and storms.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Importantly, elves have a latent ancestral memory. Most elves cannot fully control or access it, though some dedicate their entire lives to the practice, and such sages are in effect keepers of the memories of the entire elven race. More often, this manifests itself in unpredictable and unexplainable flashes: being proficient in a skill without any practice, or being able to recall exact details of events that took place long before their birth. These combine to make elves far wiser and more knowledgeable than their apparent age would suggest.</p>
            <p>Ancestral memories, however, are not passed onto half-elves.</p>

        <div class="havilon-race-description">
            <p>Elves divide their people in high elves, wood elves, dark elves, and sea elves, and consequently the half-elves or elf-blooded â€” the product of humans and elves intermingling â€” can easily be identified as having high, wood, dark, or sea elf descent.</p>
            <p>Contrary to what the name might suggest, a half-elf does not necessarily have one human and one elf parent. They simply have both traits in their lineage. Similarly, their names follow both human and elf traditions.</p>
            <p>The subraces of half-elves, or elf-blooded, are also known as high-blooded, wood-blooded, dark-blooded, and sea-blooded. Half-elves typically favor Thrizur, the patron of outcasts, but many wood- or sea-blooded favor Draconiz like their wood elf or sea elf ancestors, many dark-blooded favor Veil like their dark elf ancestors, and many high-blooded favor Emissary like their high elf ancestors.</p>

            <p>A genasi comes into being in one of two ways; as the combined offspring of a djinn and a humanoid creature (typically a human, or one with elf or orc blood); or from heavy exposure early on to one of the Elemental Planes. The types of genasi are determined by the djinn or Elemental Plane to which they possess a connection; the Elemental Plane of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water.</p>
            <p>On Havilon, genasi are incredibly rare. Rarer even than the aasimar, they have no established home on the new continent, and most genasi will flock to big cities where they more easily can blend in.</p>

            <p>A significant quantity of the Havilonian settlers were humans, and they make up almost half of the population to this day. Varied in skin tone and mannerisms, the settling humans have become a melting pot of different reflections and dialects.</p>
            <p>The humans of Havilon are experts at adapting to their environment. For example, the humans of the Eastern Sunlands are accustomed to the blazing heat and are visually distinct from their cousins, most prominently by an always healthy umber reflection, and live only slightly shorter lives than other humans and are often slimmer.</p>

On Havilon, orc-blooded often live in big cities, integrated in a society where they easily blend in with the mixed culture. Other orc-blooded have joined the orcish tribes in the northern Highland Bluffs.</p>

        <div class="havilon-race-description">
            <p>Aeons ago, tieflings were created when groups of humanoid races made a pact with an arch-demon or -devil, turning themselves and almost all their future offspring into the fiendish form known today. In the new age, it is no longer known for certain the specifics on how the tieflings came to be.</p>
            <p>The tiefling trait is often suppressed in a family, but can never be removed fully, and tieflings are therefore sometimes born into a human family, where their heritage starts manifesting during adolescence. Conversely, a traditionally human family might embrace their lineage fully, which over time leads to their being only tiefling.</p>
            <p>A tiefling has a devilish image with their tail and devil horns. The skin of a tiefling on Havilon ranges in the dark red and purple hues. Tieflings born into human lineages often have human names, while some tieflings choose to take on a surname to signify a virtue or concept they try to embody.</p>
            <p>The horns of a tiefling have nerves only at the base, like finger nails, and they grow until death. Some horns even split into branches, giving them the appearance of deer antler. The specially vain among the tieflings keep their horns in check by clipping them on regular occasions.</p>
            <p>As a race created by magic, tieflings have the innate ability to cast a selection of spells that might trace them back to their archdemon or -devil of origin. Many tieflings typically teach themselves Infernal and favor Murk or Thrizur as a deity.</p>
