{"_id":"0pmtot6Nqk2o1hRQ","name":"Race: Aasimar","content":"<h1>Aasimar</h1>\n<p>An aasimar is a humanoid creature born on the Material Plane who possesses a spark from a divine plane, often the realm of a Havilonian deity. An aasimar is always born for a specific purpose, a goal of their deity, and they each have a divine guide with whom they can commune. Aasimar are incredibly rare, and appear with glowing eyes and other luminous features that reveal their heritage.</p>\n<p>They appear in humanoid lineages, but whichever family an aasimar originates from, they nonetheless possess only the traits of an aasimar and appear to look more like which deity has blessed them. An aasimar born in an orcish family but blessed by Veil might look distinctly elvish instead of orcish.</p>\n<p>Some of these divine chosen champions stray from their path, either by choice or due to some corruption; these are called defected aasimar. The defected aasimar do not necessarily have a divine guide, and often forge their own path — often one of destruction.</p>\n<p>Aasimar are not infertile, though their children are whatever race the other parent is. This sometimes makes them very attractive to people who wish to keep their bloodline pure.</p>\n<p>Aasimar have the potential to become ageless if they fulfill the purpose they were created for, and said creator grants them this level of immortality. Usually an aasimar also has a guaranteed spot in their deity's divine domain unless they really messed up badly in life.</p>\n<p>Their souls are immortal, and one who does mess up badly, and has lived an evil life too far from the path laid before them, are reincarnated upon death as a rakshasa. Likewise with rakshasa, they may become reincarnated as aasimar. Upon reincarnation, they do not retain their memories of past selves unless granted access to them by a higher being.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Aasimar Traits</h2>\n<p>As an aasimar, you have the following traits, which replace any traits you would have had from your material lineage. You have additional traits from your subrace: Chosen Aasimar or Defected Aasimar.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> An aasimar matures at the age of 20 and can live to be up to 180. Aasimar have the potential to become ageless if they fulfill the purpose for which they were created, and said creator grants them this level of immortality. Usually an aasimar also has a guaranteed spot in their deity's divine domain unless they really messed up badly in life somehow.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Aasimar are as tall and bulky as humans. Your size is Medium.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 30 feet unless your material heritage has a higher walking speed.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Creature Type.</strong></em> You are considered both Humanoid and Celestial. You are immune to spells and effects that either one of these creature types are immune to, but you can be targeted by spells and effects that can target either one of these creature types.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Language.</strong></em> You innately know how to speak, read, and write Celestial.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> You have the ability to see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Resistance.</strong></em> You have resistance to radiant damage if you are a Chosen aasimar, or resistance to necrotic damage if you are a Defected aasimar.</p>\n<h2>Chosen Aasimar</h2>\n<p>As a Chosen aasimar, you are charged by a divine deity to do good in the world. Unlike your Defected cousins, you have yet to stray from the path set before you. You have the following additional traits.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Divine Guide.</strong></em> You have been granted a divine guide. Work with your DM to decide the nature of the guide, and if it is known to you. Once during a long rest, you may commune with it for guidance. The DM chooses the nature of the interaction, such as an omen in a dream, direct counsel, or something else.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Healing Hands.</strong></em> As an action, you can touch a creature and roll a number of d4s equal to your proficiency bonus. The target regains hit points equal to the rolled total unless it is undead or a construct. Once you use this trait, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Lightbringer.</strong></em> You know the @Compendium[zhell-custom-stuff.catalog-of-spells.8fl4H6nk1Luv93Cy]{Light} cantrip.

You may cast each of these spells once for free and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. You can also cast them with any spell slots you may have. Your favored deity decides the spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Awaken Radiance.</strong></em> Starting at 4th level, your innate divine power has materialised. You can call upon it as an action, causing your eyes to erupt in a fiery blaze. This transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. For the duration, you deal an additional 1d4 radiant damage with every weapon attack. The transformation increases in power as you reach 8th and 12th level.</p>\n<p>Starting at 8th level, when you transform, and as an action for the duration, you can shoot beams of radiant energy out of your eyes. Make a ranged spell attack against one target within 60 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes radiant damage equal to 2d8 + your ability modifier. Your favored deity decides the ability score used for this transformation. If you have a feature that allows you to make multiple attacks as part of the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.</p>\n<p>Once you reach 12th level, the transformation reaches its peak. It now also grants you a flying speed of 30 feet for the duration, as two luminous, incorporeal wings sprout from your back. Immediately when you transform, you end the frightened condition on any creature you choose within 30 feet of you provided that they can see or hear you.</p>\n<p>Once you use this trait, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Defected Aasimar</h2>\n<p>As a Defected Aasimar, whether you were corrupted by an outside force or you mustered the will yourself to forge a different path than the one set before you, you have defected from the purpose you were created to fulfill. You have the following additional traits.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Divine Guide.</strong></em> Though you have discarded your initial purpose, you may have found a new one. If so, you have been granted a new divine guide. Work with your DM to decide the nature of the guide, and if it is known to you. Once during a long rest, you may commune with it for guidance. The DM chooses the nature of the interaction, such as an omen in a dream, direct counsel, or something else.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Dark Touch.</strong></em> As an action, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within range. On a hit, the target takes necrotic damage equal to a number of d4s equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain a number of hit points equal to the amount of damage dealt. You do not regain any hit points if the target is undead or a construct. Once you use this trait, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Perilous.</strong></em> You know the @Compendium[zhell-custom-stuff.catalog-of-spells.qQ5y6cqhPJ0Dpoj9]{Blade Ward} cantrip.

Immediately when you transform, each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your save DC (using the same ability score as above) or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p>Once you use this trait, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"ssK6qqhMHUvM1A06":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_f0ya9q0abo"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.journals.d4nrptSiw1ExcPyd"}}}
{"_id":"120rlEYN1JS0rz2J","name":"Artificer Infusions","content":"<p>Artificer infusions are extraordinary processes that rapidly turn a nonmagical object into a magic item. The description of each of the following infusions details the type of object that can receive it, along with whether the resulting magic item requires attunement.</p>\n<p>Some infusions specify a minimum artificer level. You can't learn such an infusion until you are at least that level. Unless an infusion's description says otherwise, you can't learn an infusion more than once.</p>\n<h2>Arcane Propulsion Armor</h2>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 14th-level artificer<br />Item: A suit of armor (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>The wearer of this armor gains these benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The wearer's walking speed increases by 5 feet.</li>\n<li>The armor includes gauntlets, each of which is a magic melee weapon that can be wielded only when the hand is holding nothing. The wearer is proficient with the gauntlets, and each one deals 1d8 force damage on a hit and has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When thrown, the gauntlet detaches and flies at the attack's target, then immediately returns to the wearer and reattaches.</li>\n<li>The armor can't be removed against the wearer's will.</li>\n<li>If the wearer is missing any limbs, the armor replaces those limbs; hands, arms, feet, legs, or similar appendages. The replacements function identically to the body parts they replace.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Armor of Magical Strength</h2>\n<p><em>Item: A suit of armor (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>This armor has 6 charges. The wearer can expend the armor's charges in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When the wearer makes a Strength check or a Strength saving throw, it can expend 1 charge to add a bonus to the roll equal to its Intelligence modifier.</li>\n<li>If the creature would be knocked prone, it can use its reaction to expend 1 charge to avoid being knocked prone.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The armor regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>\n<h2>Boots of the Winding Path</h2>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 6th-level artificer<br />Item: A pair of boots (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>While wearing these boots, a creature can teleport up to 15 feet as a bonus action to an unoccupied space the creature can see.

The item you infuse serves as the creature's heart, around which the creature's body instantly forms.</p>\n<p>You determine the homunculus's appearance. Some artificers prefer mechanical-looking birds, whereas some like winged vials or miniature, animate cauldrons.</p>\n<p>The homunculus is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this creature's game statistics in the @Compendium[zhell-custom-stuff.catalog-of-spawns.T6AMVysbMQysxpWJ]{Homunculus Servant} stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.</p>\n<p>In combat, the homunculus shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the homunculus can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.</p>\n<p>The homunculus regains 2d6 hit points if the <em>mending</em> spell is cast on it.

The wielder can extinguish the light as a bonus action.</p>\n<p>The weapon has 4 charges. As a reaction immediately after being hit by an attack, the wielder can expend 1 charge and cause the attacker to be blinded until the end of the attacker's next turn, unless the attacker succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. The weapon regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>\n<h2>Repeating Shot</h2>\n<p><em>Item: A simple or martial weapon with the ammunition property (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>This magic weapon grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it when it's used to make a ranged attack, and it ignores the loading property if it has it.</p>\n<p>If you load no ammunition in the weapon, it produces its own, automatically creating one piece of magic ammunition when you make a ranged attack with it. The ammunition created by the weapon vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.</p>\n<h2>Replicate Magic Item</h2>\n<p>Using this infusion, you replicate a particular magic item. You can learn this infusion multiple times; each time you do so, choose a magic item that you can make with it, picking from the below lists.

{"_id":"1yzA3UHEovUsp1ZY","name":"Setting overview","content":"<h1>The Continent of Havilon</h1>\n<p>The first settlers arrived to the continent roughly a century ago. The first to arrive was an explorer, named Havilal, a clanless bronze dragonborn, and so the new world was named Havilon in his honor. A new calendar was adopted since then, with time starting at 1 PRH (<em>post rediscovery of Havilon</em>). They arrived at an eastern point, in the region that is now called the Eastern Sunlands. The dragonborn of the Eastern Sunlands these days call it Gate of the Clanless.</p>\n<p>While Havilal and his fleet were the first to arrive, the landscape is dotted with ruins of the past civilization. Each settlement is days or weeks apart, and the wilderness can be dangerous. Being stocked up and prepared is important.</p>\n<h2>On the Importance of the Continent</h2>\n<p>Havilon, as it came to be called, was the place of origin of the pantheon of Peios and Veil. It was a tragedy when the location of the entire continent, then called Iuzucae, was lost and unable to be found for roughly two thousand years. Try as people might, no word reached the continent, and no words were sent.</p>\n<p>Then, in what would be Year 1 PRH, the clanless dragonborn, Havilal, set out on an expedition to find this lost world. He was successful, but what he found was a ravaged world with no people, with wildlife and monsters having taken over the continent with free reign for so many life times.</p>\n<h2>Calendar</h2>\n<p>The calendar associated with the new age has twelve months, each with 27 days, followed by a single day each year that marks the end of the seasons. This day is called Tenebrae. Each month is three nine-days, the days of which are <em>Ardere</em>, <em>Claudere</em>, <em>Canere</em>, <em>Saltare</em>, <em>Congerere</em>, <em>Operiere</em>, <em>Glacies</em>, <em>Ventus</em>, and <em>Lux</em>.</p>\n<p>The twelve months are divided in seasons of three months each, the first and third month of each appended with Rise and End. The seasons are <em>Sationem</em>, <em>Suntide</em>, <em>Maturam</em>, and <em>Withertide</em>, meaning the twelve months, in order, are <em>Sationem's Rise</em>, <em>Sationem</em>, <em>Sationem's End</em>, <em>Suntide's Rise</em>, <em>Suntide</em>, <em>Suntide's End</em>, and so forth.</p>\n<p>The world has two moons; Luna and Sanctus.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nights with one new moon and one full moon is called a <em>winking moon</em>, which provides just enough light that travel is easy without bringing your own, however odd events have been known to occur during these nights.</li>\n<li>On nights with a <em>twin moon</em> (a double full moon), monsters are more numerous and stronger than ever, as they prowl bathed in the bright moonlight.</li>\n<li>On nights with no moons (two new moons), travel is safest but darkest, as long as one steers clear of creatures that excel in the darkness.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Regions of Havilon</h2>\n<p>The continent can be described as several subregions. These are:</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Central Flatlands.</strong></em> The Flatlands is the central area in the southern part of the continent. This region has a balanced mix of races and is home to Capital, formerly Adenastin. It is a very flat landscape that rises to the north and east. The south and south-west is mainly farmland.</p>\n<p>Central to the Central Flatlands is Capital, the largest capital of this world. A long way's travel south is Pebble, and further south still is Murharbor (Merchant's Harbor), the primary area for trade and import by the sea. Additionally, the Hunting Grounds, a prime area for hunting, is a large and dense forest due north-west of Capital.</p>\n<p>A trade route runs from the dwarven fortresses in the north to Capital, and from Capital to Murharbor through Pebble. Going south-west from Capital takes you to the Riverlands. The Flatlands also houses the Peian Monastery of secluded monks, and the training grounds of Wingskeep.</p>\n<p>A person from the Flatlands is called a <em>Flatlander</em> and a person from Capital is a <em>Capitallan</em>. </p>\n<p><em><strong>The Elven Aristocracy.</strong></em> Named the aristocracy due to its subregion where high elves have situated and founded Ascalon, the Floating City. The weather is often gray and rainy, with a terrain of rolling hills; more often than not it hosts harsh rains, and floods are not uncommon.</p>\n<p>The region has several ports along the coastline, the west of which is primarily cliffs, but the location of Whiteharbour serves as a soft inlet. A small rocky path way to the north along the cliffs and through the Great Chain serves as the easiest land access between here and the northern regions. Equally noteworthy is the Greenwood Glades, a haven of fey creatures, druids, and wood elves, with a tight relatonship with the major city of Big Hamlet in the center of the elven region.</p>\n<p>A person from Ascalon is an <em>Ascaloni</em>, and other people from the Aristocracy are <em>Aristocracites</em>.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Eastern Sunlands.</strong> </em>A sandy, rocky desert region to the east, in which many dragonborn have settled. The dragonborn have a functioning alliance with the aarakocra tribes due north of here and a warring relationship with the orcish tribes of the Highlands.</p>\n<p>A very notable location is the Gate of the Clanless, the point at which the First Explorer arrived a century ago, now a large port city. The region has many dragonborn tribes scattered near and far from the great canyon that spans the Sunlands, which is known as  the <em>barranca</em>. Each small settlement in the region is mainly self-sustaining and self-governing. If they ever require more protection, they go to either Capital or the Gates; the area is very liberal.</p>\n<p>A person from the Sunlands is called a <em>Sunlander</em>, and a person from the Gate of the Clanless a <em>Gatesman</em>.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Riverlands.</strong></em> A lowland region of farms and rich soil, which sits between the Central Flatlands and the Elven Aristocracy. In the very center, splitting the region in two, is the great river going all the way from the ocean in the south to the Great Chain, the mountain range that splits the continent in north and south.</p>\n<p>At the southern end of the great river sits the River Gates, or 'River City', an enormous city split between the east, west, and two small islands between them. A person from the Riverlands is called a <em>Riverlander</em>, and a person from River City is a <em>Riverene</em>.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Highland Bluffs.</strong></em> Located just north of the Great Chain and settled by tribes of aarakocra and caithuna. The birdfolk live in high altitudes in spires built high on top of difficult-to-navigate terrain, while the caithuna settle mainly on top of the Great Chain. Scattered in the north of the Bluffs on the ground below the spires are the numerous orcish tribes who often send raiding parties south to raid and pillage the Sunlands. The aarakocra light beacons to warn the dragonborn in advance.</p>\n<p>Due to living on the bluffs, the aarakocra are mostly ignored by the orcs.</p>\n<p>A person from the Highlands is called a <em>Highlander</em> and a person from the Great Chain mountains is called, unofficially, a <em>Chainlink</em>.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The North Swamp.</strong></em> Lastly, the swampy mess that sits west of the Highlands. This enormous region is completely inhospitable, a murky area hosting frequent monsoon rains. As the story goes, the band of the First Explorer met their end in this swamp.</p>\n<p>Of note, however, is the small town of Blackglass that sits on the edge of the Great Chain, and across the lake the location of Wyrm-End where a sizable force of holy warriors and followers met an unfortunate end.</p>","img":null,"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":2,"ssK6qqhMHUvM1A06":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.3UF6FTt7sB9UXr11"}}}
{"_id":"2RMyaCVGx3gMUaU5","name":"Race: Tiefling","content":"<h1>Tiefling</h1>\n<p>Aeons ago, tieflings were created when groups of humanoid races made a pact with an arch-demon or -devil, turning themselves and almost all their future offspring into the fiendish form known today. In the new age, it is no longer known for certain the specifics on how the tieflings came to be.</p>\n<p>The tiefling trait is often suppressed in a family, but can never be removed fully, and tieflings are therefore sometimes born into a human family, where their heritage starts manifesting during adolescence. Conversely, a traditionally human family might embrace their lineage fully, which over time leads to their being only tiefling.</p>\n<p>A tiefling has a devilish image with their tail and devil horns. The skin of a tiefling on Havilon ranges in the dark red and purple hues. Tieflings born into human lineages often have human names, while some tieflings choose to take on a surname to signify a virtue or concept they try to embody.</p>\n<p>The horns of a tiefling have nerves only at the base, like finger nails, and they grow until death. Some horns even split into branches, giving them the appearance of deer antler. The specially vain among the tieflings keep their horns in check by clipping them on regular occasions.</p>\n<p>As a race created by magic, tieflings have the innate ability to cast a selection of spells that might trace them back to their archdemon or -devil of origin. Many tieflings typically teach themselves Infernal and favor Murk or Thrizur as a deity.</p>\n<h2>Tiefling Traits</h2>\n<p>As a tiefling, you have the following traits. These vary depending on whether you are of devilish or demonic origin.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Tieflings mature by the age of 20 and live to be up to a century.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Tieflings are typically slender and vary in height from 5 to 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Creature Type.</strong></em> You are considered both Humanoid and Fiend. You choose the subtype according to your heritage, either Demon or Devil. You are immune to spells and effects that either one of these creature types are immune to, but you can be targeted by spells and effects that can target either one of these creature types.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> You have the ability to see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Dextrous Spine.</strong></em> With practice, you have learned to use your tail for more than signaling your mood. You can perform simple actions with your tail such as opening an unlocked door. Your tail can't perform actions that require fingers or significant manual dexterity, including any action that would require a check to accomplish. </p>\n<p><em><strong>Hellish Resistance.</strong></em> Your extraplanar heritage grants you resistance to either fire damage (demonic) or cold damage (devilish).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong><em>Resourcefulness.</em></strong> You know the @Compendium[zhell-custom-stuff.catalog-of-spells.OyTxTYQHOnTqeelW]{Thaumaturgy} cantrip. Starting at 4th level, you learn additional spells tied to your lineage. You can cast each of these leveled spells once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a short rest. You can also cast these spells with any spell slots you have. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells (your choice when you gain this trait).</p>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:center;width:2cm\">Player<br />Level</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Demonic Spells</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Devilish Spells</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">1st</td>\n<td>@Compendium[zhell-custom-stuff.catalog-of-spells.OyTxTYQHOnTqeelW]{Thaumaturgy}</td>\n<td>@Compendium[zhell-custom-stuff.catalog-of-spells.OyTxTYQHOnTqeelW]{Thaumaturgy}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">4th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[zhell-custom-stuff.catalog-of-spells.9e63It0CxdM4vbKc]{Hellish Rebuke} (fire damage)</td>\n<td>@Compendium[zhell-custom-stuff.catalog-of-spells.9e63It0CxdM4vbKc]{Hellish Rebuke} (cold damage)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">6th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[zhell-custom-stuff.catalog-of-spells.5SGFBbrRg6iv77Zc]{Darkness}</td>\n<td>@Compendium[zhell-custom-stuff.catalog-of-spells.gAQVJvtE82Ao1Juo]{Nondetection}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><em><strong>Flight.</strong></em> At 10th level, your heritage manifests and becomes impossible to hide.

The types of genasi are determined by the djinn or Elemental Plane to which they possess a connection; the Elemental Plane of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water.</p>\n<p>On Havilon, genasi are incredibly rare. Rarer even than the aasimar, they have no established home on the new continent, and most genasi will flock to big cities where they more easily can blend in.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Genasi Traits</h2>\n<p>As a genasi, you have all the traits of your material heritage, and in addition gain the following traits as well. However, a genasi does not gain an ability score increase, even if their material heritage would. You have additional traits from your subrace: Air Genasi, Earth Genasi, Fire Genasi, or Water Genasi.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Your base age of maturity and life span is determined by your material heritage. Genasi generally add 20 years to their expected life span.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Your base height and build are determined by your material heritage.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The air genasi are lighter and taller than their material ancestry. You can add a foot of height and subtract 20 to 40 lbs from the averages.</li>\n<li>The earth genasi are heavier and shorter than their material ancestry. You can subtract a foot of height and add 20 to 40 lbs to the averages.</li>\n<li>The fire genasi are lighter and taller than their material ancestry. You can add a foot of height and subtract 20 to 40 lbs from the averages.</li>\n<li>The water genasi are heavier and shorter than their material ancestry. You can subtract a foot of height and add 20 to 40 lbs to the averages.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base speeds are determined by your material heritage entirely.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Creature Type.</strong></em> You are considered both Humanoid and Elemental. You are immune to spells and effects that either one of these creature types are immune to, but you can be targeted by spells and effects that can target either one of these creature types. This trait replaces your Creature Type trait from your material heritage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Language.</strong></em> As part of their connection to an elemental plane, a genasi can understand and speak Primordial in addition to any other languages they know.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Resistance.</strong></em> Fire genasi gain resistance to fire damage; water genasi gain resistance to acid damage; earth genasi gain resistance to poison damage; and air genasi gain resistance to thunder damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Air Genasi</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Unending Breath.</strong></em> You can hold your breath indefinitely while you are not incapacitated.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Emissary of the Air.</strong></em> You learn a list of aerial spells as you gain levels.

The two progenitors, Peios and Veil, are the most well-known of this pantheon and have the largest amount of followers combined.</p>\n<p>The pantheon is, in essence, divided in two; the deities associated most closely with Peios are called the White deities, and on the side of Veil, the Dark deities. Beyond the progenitors, combined there are six lesser deities, called a major or minor deity in reference to the quantity of their following and the breadth of their domain.</p>\n<table style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:12cm\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width:4cm;text-align:center\">Rank</th>\n<th style=\"width:4cm;text-align:center\">White</th>\n<th style=\"width:4cm;text-align:center\">Dark</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Progenitors</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Peios</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Veil</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Major deity</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Emissary, Draconiz</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Murk, Anvil</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Minor deity</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Arepo</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Thrizur</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Having a Dark deity as a patron is not seen as evil; the goals of a devout follower and their patron may be entirely different, though a follower is expected to follow the tenets of their deity.</p>\n<h1>White Deities</h1>\n<table style=\"border:none\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong><em>Peios, Embodiment of Order.</em></strong> Peios is humanoid with stoic golden features, no hair, and he casts no shadow. He represents law and order. To worship Peios is to be systematic, adhere to reason, follow the letters of the law, and stamp out chaos. The holy symbol of Peios is a single, gazing eye, a symbol of his considering mind.</p>\n<p>Those who follow Peios shape reality around them. A carriage arrives right on your doorstep despite being across the town moments before; wherever you sit, you find a chair; every location has exactly what you need by mere chance; and you never find yourself lost or stumbling.</p>\n<p>The truly devout can bend reality to their will, fabricating objects or even creatures out of thin air with their divine power, and shaping the area around them to suit their needs. The power of Peios' followers, a peian, comes from their mind; a follower of high standing needs no weapon as long as they have their head, and they may even find themselves in multiple places at once.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>To gain the favor of Peios, a player can consider the following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Building or restoring a temple to Peios. Peios accepts worship from anyone who is not chaotic in their base nature. Keeping order is paramount.</li>\n<li>Helping preserve the balance of power in a city. The status quo is an important aspect to maintain when preserving balance. Smaller settlements like towns or outskirt villages are more Thrizur's domain.</li>\n<li>Carrying out punishment on a fugitive from justice. Criminals, by default, are disorderly and are to be held in check to preserve law and order.</li>\n<li>Solving a challenging riddle or puzzle. Raw power is not important to Peios. It is much better to resolve a test of strength using wit or skill.</li>\n<li>Besting a Champion of Anvil, preferably through skill. Followers of Peios and Anvil are directly opposed, where Peios brings law and order, and Anvil has no care in this regard.</li>\n<li>Assisting lawgivers in their duties and generally bringing order in times of chaos.</li>\n<li>Honoring an oath. Conversely, breaking an oath is the highest offense to Peios</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:6cm\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/6031826c83ef59f0ff7fedfa/modules/zhell-custom-stuff/images/symbols/holy_peios.webp\" width=\"100%\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><em><strong>Emissary, Lord of Creation.</strong></em> Emissary appears as tall, nondescript, and elven with glowing azure skin and is the patron of most users of arcane magic. Widely regarded as the lord of magic, worshipping Emissary is no different than casting a spell of arcane origin, and especially ritual casters might interweave their chanting with a short prayer. The holy symbol of Emissary is a balance, symbolic of the relation between the material and ethereal planes.</p>\n<p>The followers of Emissary adhere to logic above all else. Many see them as cold and unfeeling in their actions, each step they take one measured objectively to an extreme degree. They often do not understand emotions, instead stepping through the world in search of knowledge or greater power and understanding in the arts of the arcane. They value magic and knowledge.</p>\n<p>Conversely, those with no magical ability pay Emissary no mind, and he pays those with no worth to him no mind either. The truly devout followers of Emissary are forces to be reckoned with, creating spectacles grander than anyone can imagine. A single and most-powerful follower of Emissary could, if they so willed, burn a forest to the ground in a fortnight.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>To gain the favor of Emissary, a player can consider the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gain a new arcane skill, such as learning a spell.</li>\n<li>Conjure great magical spectacles. Not for anyone else, but for the follower themself.</li>\n<li>Stay on the path of learning and knowledge above the path of friendship or emotions. These are, to Emissary, only chemical reactions that get in the way of what is most important in this world.</li>\n<li>Increase the breadth of knowledge in the world. However, to Emissary, whether said knowledge is hoarded or shared is immaterial.</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:6cm\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/6031826c83ef59f0ff7fedfa/modules/zhell-custom-stuff/images/symbols/holy_emissary.webp\" width=\"100%\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><em><strong>Draconiz, Aspect of Nature.</strong></em> Lord of the skies and nature, Draconiz may appear in humanoid form as either an aarakocra or dragonborn, in all manner of vibrant colours. Some misguided individuals depict him as a half-dragon. When seen in his real form, he appears as a gigantic dark dragon with prismatic wings.</p>\n<p>Most dragonborn revere Draconiz as their creator, and many captains and griffon riders might say a small prayer to Draconiz for good fortune on their journey. His holy symbol is a dragon's head in profile, a symbol of his might.</p>\n<p>The deities, Draconiz and Emissary, have a long and complicated relationship and often avoid each other for reasons that are unknown to mortal people.</p>\n<p>The followers of Draconiz value strength above all else. Break down the door, smash the frame into pieces, and do not waver in your resolve for even a moment. In groups, followers of the dragon are unstoppable, a force to be reckoned with, and as powerful as an army even in small numbers.</p>\n<p>They hold no value in being great thinkers or scholars, instead pride themselves in shows of power and brawn. Secondly, a follower of Draconiz feels ill at home in a city, often instead favoring smaller settlements or natural settings. Though they are great in number, they can often be found congregated in secluded locations. Also friends of beasts and the skies, the followers favor animals and travel.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>To gain the favor of Draconiz, a player can consider the following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Protecting a glade; as most followers prefer not living in cities, they favor whichever secluded area they can find.</li>\n<li>Exacting vengeance for a significant wrong done to you, usually with a show of strength.</li>\n<li>Helping preserve the balance of power in any natural setting.</li>\n<li>Winning a great feat of strength or skill.</li>\n<li>Defeating a creature that has stepped out of its place, especially powerful aberrations.</li>\n<li>Healing a sick or injured wild animal.

Where one might pray to Anvil for luck in a coming battle, Arepo is the deity of natural beauty, such as the spring flowers and the fall leaves, and niceties such as everlasting friendship, hope, altruism, and kindness.</p>\n<p>His immediate usefulness not apparent, Arepo's existence is often disregarded even among clerics and is even lesser known among the common folk. Few recognise his holy symbol, a single curved leaf.</p>\n<p>By far the most down-to-earth of all the Havilonian deities, Arepo cares very little for formalities or grandeur. His followers should treat anyone with respect regardless of stature, and in return they can expect a close relationship with their favored deity, much more so than with any other god.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>To gain the favor of Arepo, a player can consider the following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating a secluded shrine. Arepo does not favor grand temples or big gestures, instead resorting to minor shrines such as a candle in a backroom, a short prayer over food, and so forth.</li>\n<li>Ensuring that the deeds of someone are preserved. A person dies twice; once physically and once again when all memories of them fade. Followers of Arepo see to it that the second death never happens.</li>\n<li>Making friends. Any new acquaintance is a potential ally, and followers of Arepo never assume the worst up front.</li>\n<li>Feeding those who are starving, or creating fertile croplands. Under the guidance of Arepo, no one should go hungry, no matter who they are or where they come from.</li>\n<li>Aiding the weak or impeding the strong. Arepo and his followers, few as they are, seek out first and foremost to help those without the means to help themselves.</li>\n<li>Keeping calm in the face of danger. The arepoan followers should never give into fury or destruction.</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:6cm\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/6031826c83ef59f0ff7fedfa/modules/zhell-custom-stuff/images/symbols/holy_arepo.webp\" width=\"100%\" /></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1>Dark Deities</h1>\n<table style=\"border:none\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><em><strong>Veil, Lady of Death and Madness.</strong></em> It is said that Veil is the shadow of Peios. As the antithesis of Peios, she represents entropy and death. Veil is humanoid, appearing as a slender maiden or withered hag, with dark skin and seems to almost absorb light. Veil is said to stomp abandoned souls into the walls and pavement of the Wailing Citadel. Her holy symbol is a dark vortex, symbolic of the descent into madness. To worship Veil is to bring an end to haunting souls and maddened individuals.</p>\n<p>For a follower of Veil, life is sacred. They value the safe passage of souls and the protection of the youths. It is veilkeepers, those who work in the veilmanors, the houses of the dead, that see to it that the souls of the recently departed have a safe journey on to the Wailing Citadel where the gods may sort them into their final resting place. To some followers of Veil, madness quickly follows; in many cases this can be argued to be both a blessing and a curse as with her madness also come great gifts and power. One can never truly know if the lunatic is insane, or one of Veil's highest ranking pious militants.</p>\n<p>Veil is importantly a resentful god, one who takes great offense to being mistreated. To spit in the face of Veil is a death sentence in and of itself. The highest among her followers are masters over death. They both circumvent and protect the cycle of life and death and are fearsome to behold. Rarely do high-ranking followers of Veil congregate, instead they are often on missions on her behalf, often related to stomping out death-defying creatures such as the undead, or those who create too much death in their wake.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>To gain the favor of Veil, a player can consider the following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Building or restoring a temple or shrine in her name. Even just paying respects is greatly appreciated by Veil, same is providing coins and overseeing burial rites for those slain during a tragedy.</li>\n<li>Easing someone's death or assisting with funeral arrangements.</li>\n<li>Curing a dangerous affliction or destroying the undead.</li>\n<li>Taking decisive action on impulse.</li>\n<li>Avenging the helpless, especially children. Why protecting the youngest among the people is so important to Veil is not truly known.</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:6cm\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/6031826c83ef59f0ff7fedfa/modules/zhell-custom-stuff/images/symbols/holy_veil.webp\" width=\"100%\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><em><strong>Murk, Weaver of Fate.</strong></em> Murk is a reclusive deity, a seeker of knowledge, and the patron of many scholars, often depicted as a tiefling woman. Her reclusive nature leaves her something of a mystery. Being a symbol for the advancement of knowledge, most mages favour either Murk or Emissary, with Murk favoured highly in places of general and public learning such as libraries or colleges.</p>\n<p>Her holy symbol is a shaded cauldron. To worship Murk is to seek out knowledge, unveil mysteries, and catalogue uncharted territory. Referred to as the Weaver or the Horned One, the destinies of mortals are said to be written in scrolls by Murk.</p>\n<p>Once a year in Withertide, followers of Murk pay tribute to healers, teachers, and weavers. The community comes together to weave a large tapestry, and high ranking followers imbue the tapestry to predict the fate of a local child, and they make promises for the following year as an appeal to fate.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>To gain the favor of Murk, a player can consider the following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensuring that the deeds and more importantly knowledge of someone who has died are preserved. All knowledge is important and should be preserved in the eyes of Murk. Even if it may have no apparent value at present, it will some day. Similarly, a player may consider going to remote locations to recover lost knowledge, uncover new knowledge, or chart unknown territory.</li>\n<li>Preserving something despite its usefulness. Broken treasure or artifacts still hold historical value.</li>\n<li>Saving people from the brink of death, especially so if it involves creating a new cure. Murk is a healer and a mother to those who favor her. Under her, followers should see to it that no unfortunate circumstances befall the undeserving.</li>\n<li>Restoring a shrine or temple to Murk. This can take many forms for Murk, though the rare displays of grand gestures are appreciated by her. One could offer up a recovered artifact in her name or claim a remote area as a historical location.</li>\n<li>Appeasing the flow of fate or aiding a chosen champion or servant of the deities, white or dark. If the fates are woven by Murk, one should make sure not to destroy her work.</li>\n<li>Teaching others new methods, researching lore, protecting a place of learning, and uncovering truths or unveiling mysteries.</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:6cm\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/6031826c83ef59f0ff7fedfa/modules/zhell-custom-stuff/images/symbols/holy_murk.webp\" width=\"100%\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><em><strong>Anvil, Smith of Strife.</strong></em> Anvil is a bulky red-haired dwarf, often depicted with darker skin. Often the patron of craftsmen, dwarves, warriors, and warlords, his holy symbol is fittingly a shaded anvil. He grants his favour to those who keep the world moving and in turmoil. His holy symbol is fittingly a shaded anvil.</p>\n<p>To follow Anvil is to leave a path of destruction and turmoil. A shopkeeper is bullied into selling his stock for mere copper pieces; a zoo is left unlocked and the animals free-roaming; or the prison of a city has suffered a large-scale jailbreak, you can take the bet that a follower of Anvil has passed by and had their own particular kind of fun with the place.</p>\n<p>Also the patron of artisans and musicians, the very people that shape the culture of the world, to a craftsman devout to Anvil shaping a set of plate armor comes easy and natural, and that 117-page poetry book simply flows out of a poet of Anvil with no writer's block. To a follower of Anvil, their asset is their hands and their ability to craft or even destroy. A locked door blocking your way is much easier to smash into pieces than it is to find its missing key.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>To gain the favor of Anvil, a player can consider the following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build or restore a shrine to Anvil. A shrine to Anvil can take many forms, usually involving a great display of grandeur, such as a massive temple, an architectural masterpiece, or even an art exhibit.</li>\n<li>Sowing chaos in a city. Creating turmoil where order reigns pleases Anvil greatly as long as it is for personal gain.</li>\n<li>Manifesting a masterpiece. Art and creation is what a follower of Anvil should aspire to be great at. This can be anything from paintings to poetry and armor pieces and buildings.</li>\n<li>Brute forcing your way with great success. There is no need to do things the right way if the wrong way gets there faster, the consequences be damned.</li>\n<li>Taking great risks for great rewards.</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:6cm\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/6031826c83ef59f0ff7fedfa/modules/zhell-custom-stuff/images/symbols/holy_anvil.webp\" width=\"100%\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><em><strong>Thrizur, the Shelter.</strong></em> Depicted as an orc, Thrizur is the patron of outcasts, such as half-elves, and half-orcs; those people who find that they fit nowhere by their nature. Orc tribes who have adopted the Havilonian pantheon typically lean towards Thrizur as well due to the obvious familial link. His holy symbol is a wolf's head. To worship Thrizur can take many forms, most related to tribal or settlement culture.</p>\n<p>To follow Thrizur is to provide safe harbor for people. Many innkeepers follow Thrizur and bless their homes in his name. Hunters and trackers go about their lives in his name as well, and with his blessing they are able to create settlements and find shelter from the weather with great ease. When a small town springs up in a remote location in record time, one can be certain Thrizur has been involved in some way.</p>\n<p>The highest of his following are able to weather any storm and track any beast with great ease.

Hunting to feed a people is seen as an equally big tribute.</li>\n<li>Building a settlement, a home, or providing safe shelter for travelers and outcasts of society.</li>\n<li>Conjuring up a great bounty or feast.</li>\n<li>Safeguarding nature such that people can live within it peacefully.</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:6cm\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/6031826c83ef59f0ff7fedfa/modules/zhell-custom-stuff/images/symbols/holy_thrizur.webp\" width=\"100%\" /></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","img":null,"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"ssK6qqhMHUvM1A06":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Y5FZPN6HraNm56mb"}}}

{"_id":"OxOFNpKA6jnWqWkR","name":"Race: Half-Orc","content":"<h1>Half-Orc</h1>\n<p>The half-orcs, or orc-blooded, are humanoid born of old alliances between human and orc tribes. Though such a thing is rare in this age, the half-orcs are still around. Half-orcs have grayish skin, big jaws, prominent teeth, and a larger build than most. On Havilon, half-orcs often live in big cities, integrated in a society where they easily blend in with the mixed culture. Other half-orcs have joined the orcish tribes in the northern Highland Bluffs.</p>\n<p>As the patron of outcasts, and as he is depicted as an orc himself, many orc-blooded favor Thrizur.</p>\n<h2>Half-Orc Traits</h2>\n<p>As a half-orc, you have the following traits.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Half-orcs mature and reach adulthood around age 15. They age noticeably fast and rarely live longer than 80 years. For every point of Strength you have above 10, and for every two points of Dexterity above 10, your expected lifespan increases by 10 years.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Half-orcs are somewhat larger and bulkier than humans, and they range from 5 to well over 6 feet tall and with an average weight of 220 lbs. Your size is Medium.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Creature Type.</strong></em> You are Humanoid.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Relentless Endurance.</strong></em> When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You do not become prone, and you may immediately use your reaction to make one weapon attack against a target in range. You cannot use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Savage Attacks.</strong></em> When you score a critical hit with a weapon attack, you can roll one of the damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Aggressive.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can move up to your speed toward an enemy of your choice that you can see or hear. You must end this move closer to the enemy than you started.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Powerful Build.</strong></em> You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Indestructible.</strong></em> Starting at 12th level, you gain resistance to non-magical bludgeoning damage. In addition, you have advantage on all saving throws to resist the stunned condition.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"ssK6qqhMHUvM1A06":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_f0ya9q0abo"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.journals.sYqxzMZntBLD50pn"}}}

{"_id":"gqBZGe8D2umcSXFO","name":"Race: Elf","content":"<h1>Elf</h1>\n<p>The elven races have predominantly occupied the western region, so named the Elven Aristocracy by the then-dominant high elves of Ascalon.</p>\n<p>The Aristocracy is a haven for elves, druids, and arcane magic users. The high elves have situated themselves primarily in the Floating City, Ascalon, in the northern area of the Aristocracy, and the wood elves in the Greenwood Glades, a dense, miles-wide jungle forest on the north-east border between the Aristocracy and the Riverlands.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The high elves of Havilon live in seclusion atop Ascalon, the Floating City, in the Elven Aristocracy. Under the leadership of Sky Baron Gephostos, they are a high-magic, self-sufficient minor nation that rarely, if ever, allows anyone inside but other high elves or those who have earned their favor. Any high elf is by their very nature born with the ability to cast magic.</li>\n<li>The wood elves of Havilon live in harmony in the Greenwood Glades, just shy of the Great Chain mountains. The jungle-forest is a haven of fey and druidic magic on the border of the Elven Aristocracy. Upon death, wood elves of the Greenwood Glades or anywhere with a strong woodland connection are born into trees. This means the wood elf joins a grove and lives a second life as part of a hivemind.</li>\n<li>The dark elves, conversely, have not congregated to call a region their own. Commonly, many dark elves are not considered native to Havilon, but native to the Underdark as on many other continents, and dark elves who have left the Underdark behind to lead a life on the surface are few and far between. Unlike their cousins, the dark elves do not have an innate connection to magic, the elements, or nature, but to gemstones.</li>\n<li>The aquatic sea elves have founded a string of subterranean villages near the western and northern coasts of Havilon as an expansion of their underwater society since the rediscovery of the continent. They are a rare sight when you venture inland. An innately magical race like their high elven cousins, the sea elves are adept swimmers with strong ties to the weather and storms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Importantly, elves have a latent ancestral memory. Most elves cannot fully control or access it, though some dedicate their entire lives to the practice, and such sages are in effect keepers of the memories of the entire elven race. More often, this manifests itself in unpredictable and unexplainable flashes: being proficient in a skill without any practice, or being able to recall exact details of events that took place long before their birth. These combine to make elves far wiser and more knowledgable than their apparent age would suggest.</p>\n<p>Ancestral memories, however, are not passed onto half-elves.</p>\n<h2>Elf Traits</h2>\n<p>As an elf, you have the following traits. You have additional traits from your subrace: High Elf, Wood Elf, Sea Elf, or Dark Elf.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood around the age of 100 and can live to be 500 years old. However, elves typically go mad after the first three to four centuries, becoming reclusive and sometimes violent. It is incredibly rare to see a coherent and sane elf older than 400 years.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Elves are typically slender and vary in height from race to race. Your size is Medium.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your movement speed depends on your lineage.</p>\n<table style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:11cm\" border=\"0\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width:3cm;text-align:center\">Race</th>\n<th style=\"width:3cm;text-align:center\">Height</th>\n<th style=\"width:5cm;text-align:center\">Movement<br />Speed</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">High Elf</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">6 to 8 feet</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">30 feet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Wood Elf</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">5 to 7 feet</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">35 feet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Dark Elf</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">5 to 6 feet</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">30 feet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Sea Elf</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">6 to 7 feet</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">30 feet,<br />40 feet (swim)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><em><strong>Creature Type.</strong></em> Unless your race tells you otherwise, you are Humanoid.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>High Elf</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Ancestral Memory.</strong></em><em> </em><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">You have advantage on saving throws to avoid being charmed.

Each caithuna belongs to a clan whose names are based on their geographical location, such as Bright Cliffs or Rumbling River.</p>\n<p>The caithuna of Havilon are also known for their brewing talents. As a tribal race, the people often favor Thrizur and Draconiz.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Caithuna Traits</h2>\n<p>As a caithuna, you have the following traits.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> A caithuna matures at the age of 10 and can live to be up to 80.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Caithun stand at about 5-8 feet and weigh anywhere between 150 to 300 pounds, some of them lithe, some of them enormous. Regardless of where you are in this range, your size is Medium.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your walking speed is 35 feet, and you have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Creature Type.</strong></em> You are considered both Humanoid and Beast. You are immune to spells and effects that either one of these creature types are immune to, but you can be targeted by spells and effects that can target either one of these creature types.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Cat's Claws.</strong></em> You can use your claws to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier slashing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> You have the ability to see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\n<p><em><strong>On all Fours.</strong></em> When you would take damage from falling, you take only half damage.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Pounce.</strong></em> You can add your proficiency bonus to your initiative rolls. In addition, you can use your bonus action to jump a number of feet equal to five times your Strength or Dexterity modifier (whichever is highest). This movement does not trigger opportunity attacks, and you can use it only if your speed is greater than 0. You can make this jump twice and regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Feline Folk.</strong></em> When you reach 4th level, you gain advantage on all ability checks that involve cats or other feline creatures (excluding caithuna). Once you reach 8th level, you learn the @Compendium[zhell-custom-stuff.catalog-of-spells.QJv758fJ4r6pJYbg]{Find Familiar} spell, which you may cast only as a ritual. The summoned familiar can only be a cat.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Nine Lives.</strong></em> Once you reach 12th level, you gain the ability to shrug off death. When you fail a death saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead. You can do this exactly nine times over the course of your life. If you ever die and come back to life via resurrection or other means, you regain all expended uses of this trait.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"ssK6qqhMHUvM1A06":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_f0ya9q0abo"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.journals.Szw0HC5KJbSP4mtU"}}}

{"_id":"vc1TC0KAzEbNaWB4","name":"Race: Dragonborn","content":"<h1>Dragonborn</h1>\n<p>Settled in the Eastern Sunlands, the dragonborn thrive under the scorching sun of the deserts that fill the region, sometimes settling in the canyons that spreads throughout like a maze. The dragonborn societies of Havilon see Draconiz, the Aspect of Nature, as their favored deity. They have a decades-long war with the orcs of the northern regions, whose raiding parties target the smaller dragonborn settlements and nomadic tribes. The dragonborn are not secular, though not many other races thrive as well as they do in the high temperatures, so most settlements in the Eastern Sunlands are predominantly dragonborn. Havilal, the First Explorer, was notably a bronze dragonborn, and this is a point of pride among the draconic settlers.</p>\n<p>Dragonborn have a single name with several hard consonants, appended with the name of their clan, whose name is always long and hard to pronounce for other peoples, such as Morbor of Teccushtar.</p>\n<p>The dragonborn are visually distinct from one another by the color of their scales as a member of either the chromatic, metallic, or the rarer gem dragonborn. Though draconic, <span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">the dragonborn have no tail or wings.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The chromatic dragonborn have scales of black, blue, green, red, or white.</li>\n<li>The metallic dragonborn have scales of brass, bronze, copper, gold, or silver.</li>\n<li>The gem dragonborn have scales intervowen with colors of amethyst, crystal, emerald, sapphire, or topaz.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the animal kingdom, whenever eggs need to be transported, a reptile parent carries them in the mouth, which is reasonably low to the ground, and thus accidentally dropping it is not too much of a danger. This is not the case with dragonborn, being bipedal creatures who carry their eggs around in their arms; dragonborn eggs have hence evolved a rubbery and bouncy shell, but of course now it is more common to secure the eggs in slings and holsters.</p>\n<p>Dragonborn architecture consists primarily of stone, as buildings burning down would otherwise be a very frequent problem when one sixth of your population is born with the ability to spew flames. For similar reasons, barbequed, smoked, marinated, and chilled food is a big part of dragonborn culture as well.</p>\n<h2>Dragonborn Traits</h2>\n<p>As a dragonborn, you have the following traits. You have additional traits from your subrace: Chromatic Dragonborn or Metallic Dragonborn.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Dragonborn are hatched from eggs, and the young Dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Creature Type.</strong></em> You are considered both Humanoid and Dragon. You are immune to spells and effects that either one of these creature types are immune to, but you can be targeted by spells and effects that can target either one of these creature types.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Draconic Ancestry.</strong></em> You trace your ancestry to a chromatic or metallic dragon, granting you a special magical affinity. Choose one type of dragon from these dragon types. This determines the damage type for your other traits you have.</p>\n<div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:row\">\n<table style=\"width:5cm;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Chromatic<br />Dragon</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Damage<br />Type</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Black</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Acid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Blue</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Lightning</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Green</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Poison</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Red</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Fire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">White</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Cold</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:5cm;border:0;margin-right:auto\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Metallic<br />Dragon</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Damage<br />Type</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Brass</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Fire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Bronze</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Lightning</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Copper</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Acid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Gold</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Fire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Silver</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">Cold</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p><em><strong>Draconic Resistance.</strong></em> You have resistance to the damage type associated with your Draconic Ancestry trait.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Draconic Warding.</strong></em> Once you reach 14th level, you can magically empower your Draconic Resistance. You can use an action to become immune to the damage type associated with your Draconic Ancestry trait. This effect lasts for 1 hour or until you end it (no action required). Once you use this trait, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Chromatic Dragonborn</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Breath Weapon.</strong></em> When you take the Attack action, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of a magical energy in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d8 damage of the type associated with your Draconic Ancestry on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. This damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (3d8), 11th level (4d8), and 17th level (5d8).</p>\n<p>You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Spellclaw.</strong></em> When you make an unarmed strike with your fists, you can choose to instead make a spell attack. When you hit with this attack, the strike deals 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier, and the damage type is the one associated with your Draconic Ancestry, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Your spellcasting ability for this trait is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (your choice when you gain this trait).</p>\n<p><em><strong>Chrome Stride.</strong></em> At 6th level, you learn the @Compendium[zhell-custom-stuff.catalog-of-spells.fIWvlYAieEiG7sL1]{Ashardalon's Stride} spell. The damage type is the same as the one associated with your Draconic Ancestry, instead of fire. You can cast the spell once and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. You can also cast the spell with any spell slots you have. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell (your choice when you gain this trait).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Chrome View.</em></strong> You have the ability to see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern all color in darkness as shades of one hue; black, blue, green, red, or white, depending on your Draconic Ancestry.</p>\n<h2>Metallic Dragonborn</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Breath Weapon.</strong></em> When you take the Attack action, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of a magical energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d8 damage of the type associated with your Draconic Ancestry on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. This damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (3d8), 11th level (4d8), and 17th level (5d8).</p>\n<p>You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Metal Attraction.</strong></em> At 4th level, you learn the @Compendium[zhell-custom-stuff.catalog-of-spells.b3lQMF6KFxbhzQBF]{Attract Metal} spell. You can cast this spell once and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. You can also cast it with any spell slots you have. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell (your choice when you gain this trait).</p>\n<p><em><strong>Metallic Breath Weapon.</strong></em> At 8th level you gain a second breath weapon. When you take the Attack action, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of a magical gas in a 15-foot cone. The save DC for this breath is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength, Constitution, or Dexterity modifier (your choice when you gain this trait). When you use this ability, choose one:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each creature in the area must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 20 feet away from you and be knocked prone.</li>\n<li>Each creature in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated until the start of your next turn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you use your Metallic Breath Weapon, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"ssK6qqhMHUvM1A06":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_f0ya9q0abo"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.journals.4dH2OknguVxpD44e"}}}

{"_id":"zeetxDeoZ4zcQflH","name":"Race: Dwarf","content":"<h1>Dwarf</h1>\n<p>The dwarves settled with varying levels of success along the Great Chain, the mountain range spanning the continent from east to west. Here they have refurbished abandoned ruins in the bowels of the Chain to create a series of gargantuan fortresses as well as villages in the surrounding hillscapes.</p>\n<p>Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male and female dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully. Part of dwarven marriage ceremonies includes braiding rings or beads crafted by their new spouse into each other's beards.</p>\n<p>Most dwarves favor Anvil, either due to the familial link or by virtue of craftsmanship or artisanry.</p>\n<p>As a dwarf reaches the end of their life, they slowly start turning to stone over the last few decades, finally dying as it spreads to their chest and head. A dwarf that has died of old age is usually broken down into cement, then sculpted into a tile or similar for the family tomb.</p>\n<p>A dwarf that does not die to natural causes starts turning to stone the moment they draw their last breath. Over the course of an hour they become a statue. This has the consequence of leaving macabre statues around when a dwarf has died in tragic and remote circumstances. This, however, also makes it harder to quickly dispose of the body of a murdered dwarf.</p>\n<h2>Dwarf Traits</h2>\n<p>As a dwarf, you have the following traits.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Dwarves mature by their late teens, but they are considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live to be about 350 years.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 200 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Creature Type.</strong></em> You are Humanoid.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Dwarven Resilience.</strong></em> You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Dwarven Fortitude.</strong></em> Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level. In addition, whenever you take the Dodge action in combat, you can spend one hit die to heal yourself. You roll a hit die and regain hit points equal to the roll plus your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1).</p>\n<p><em><strong>Bulk Training.</strong></em> Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor that you do not meet the Strength requirements for. Once you reach 10th level, you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Nimble.</strong></em> At 4th level, you gain advantage on any checks you make to escape from being grappled.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Sturdy.</strong></em> Starting at 4th level, when you make a saving throw to avoid being pushed, pulled, knocked prone, or otherwise moved against your will, you may make the saving throw with advantage.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Dwarven Skin.</strong></em> Starting at 8th level, you can draw on unyielding stone to shrug off harm. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to halve the damage. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"ssK6qqhMHUvM1A06":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_f0ya9q0abo"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.journals.BEtBWidxa4bqtqWG"}}}
